My scraping project

What I want to do:
Scrape all players from http://www.mlssoccer.com/players
There are about 500 players.

Why:
I want to answer some questions such as:
Who is the youngest player?
Who is the oldest player?
What are all the Twitter handles of all the players?
Which country has produced the most MLS players?
How many different teams have U.S.-born players?

Step 1: 

Get the URLs for each player detail page.
Players are listed on pages with URLs of this type:
http://www.mlssoccer.com/players
http://www.mlssoccer.com/players?page=1
http://www.mlssoccer.com/players?page=2
Last page:
http://www.mlssoccer.com/players?page=20

Player detail pages have URLs like this:
http://www.mlssoccer.com/players/anatole-abang
http://www.mlssoccer.com/players/alex
http://www.mlssoccer.com/players/jeremy-gagnon-lapare

Step 2:
Get the following data for each player:

Name 		ex. Jeremy Gagnon-Lapare
Team 		ex. Montreal Impact
Position 	ex. Midfielder
Birthplace	ex. Sherbrooke, QC
Birthday	ex. 20 (03/09/1995)
Twitter		NOT ALL HAVE THIS
