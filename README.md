# My first homemade Web scraper

Everything you need to know about this repo is in [this document](http://bit.ly/mm-scrape-example).

Basically, it is a walkthrough of solving a fairly small scraping problem: How can I get six items of data about every player in Major League Soccer? There are just over 500 players, so that's why it's a "fairly small" scraping problem.

This is a model for students who are embarking on their first solo scraping project.
